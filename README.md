# Savory-Class-Model

## Overview
This is a useful sheet you can use to model putting on Holistic Comprehensive Management (HCM) and Ecological Outcome Verification (EOV) classes for the Savory network in your context and look at the financials of the class.

## Use Cases
- Online classes and In-person classes with lodging and meals (or not), or
- Plan with generic attendees, or
- Plan an actual class, putting actual attendees in.  It comes with default values that may or may not apply in your context.  These are values that may make sense in Montana, USA.

## Key Sheets:
| Sheet | Function |
|:--|:--|
| *Input and Summary Sheet* | Assumptions are put here.  See what the economics of the class are - will you lose or gain money on it? |
| *Class Roster* | Put in class attendees and paid instructors and facilitators, customizing pay and tuition values from the default if necessary. |
| *Task and Transaction List* | A suggested list of tasks with deadlines to help organize getting the class done and a detailed list of transactions that will likely happen as a result of the inputs. |

## Who Made This and Why
We were trying to do our financial planning for our [Montana Savory Hub](https://montanaworkinglands.org), and we needed to see what the best approach was for putting on a class.
